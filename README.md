# Steps to operate
1) Browse directory to share or copy and paste the path of location which you want to serve.
2) Add IP address in the field if it is empty, By default it takes ip address directly from ipconfig command but if you want to serve on ipv6 address or different ip address of any other network interface, You can do that also using Ipconfig button to check.
3) Add port number if you want to change the default one which is port number 8000.
4) Press the Start server button. 
5) Visit http://IP:PORT
6) After work done stop the server that's it.

## Note
After server started if you click again on start server button which is not mandatory, program will terminate itself. As i have added one function to close before opened session on that port causes the termination of software itself.
